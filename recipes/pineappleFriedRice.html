    or as part of a Chinese banquet</p>

    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>

      <p>1 Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Add the eggs, swirling them up the sides, to make a thin omelette. Once cooked through,
        roll the omelette onto a chopping board and cut into ribbons. </p>

    <li>
      <p>Heat the remaining oil. Add the garlic, onions and five-spice. Stir-fry until sizzling, then add the rice (if using
        pouches, squeeze them first, to separate the grains), peas, sesame oil and soy. Cook over a high heat until the rice
        is hot, then stir through the pineapple and omelette ribbons.</p>
