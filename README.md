This is the first project on the odin project(TOP).

The skills this project will showcase are HTML including attributes and will move onto styling with CSS.

In the future I may add interactivity with JS.

I have been learning to code on and off for the past 6 years. Between working and having 3 kids, I've had my hands full but I think I am now ready to level up my skills!

I am starting from the beginning, getting refreshed as have not been coding in around 12-18 months. Hopefully the bike analogy works here too!
